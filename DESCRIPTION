Description:
  Autocropping automatically removes surrounding white space form an image.
  Most image processing software (e.g. gimp, Irfanview, imageMagik, etc.)
  have this capability.  This package provides a single function to do just this.
  A few options are available that allow the user to write the cropped image out
  to a new file and also to leave a border of white space around the image.
